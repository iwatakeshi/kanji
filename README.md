[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/iwatakeshi/kanji.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A Kanji dictionary for the web.

The available grades are from first through sixth.

Note: Only part of the first has been added and will continue to expand along the way.


The benefits of using this:

* modular - easily create a dictionary by grade (follows a similar pattern as moment.js).
* examples with ruby
* easy to use API
	* findByRomaji (available as a static method to narrow down results)
	* findByMeaning (available as a static method to narrow down results)
	* findByOnyomi (note all on-yomi must be Katakana)
	* findByKunYomi (note all kun-yomi must be Hiragana)
* works with node.js
* locale support (search kanji in your locale)

###Usage

In browser

```html
	<script type="text/javascript" src="kanji.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="kanji.grade.first.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="kanji.locale.es.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript">
		var k = kanji();
		k.findByMeaning('round');
		/* output

			character: "å††", 
			example: Array[5], 
			kunyomi: Array[1],

			onyomi: Array[1], 
			romaji: "en"
		}
		*/
	</script>
